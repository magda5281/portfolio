## 💡 How to Play?

1. Guess a letter by clicking a button or pressing a key.
2. If the letter is in the word, it will appear in the correct position.
3. If the letter is incorrect, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
4. The game ends when:
   - The player guesses all letters correctly (WIN 🎉).
   - The player makes 6 incorrect guesses (LOSE 💀).
5. Press `Enter` to start a new game after winning or losing.

## 📱 Responsive Design

### **Scaling Hangman Drawing**

- The game automatically adjusts for smaller screens (`<520px`) using `@media`
  queries in CSS.
- `transform: scale(0.6)` is applied to shrink the Hangman drawing on smaller
  screens .

### **Adaptive Keyboard Layout**

- Uses `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(50px, 1fr))` to adjust
  keyboard button sizes dynamically.

## 🪡 Customization

- **Change word list**: Modify `wordList.json` to include your own words.
- **Update styles**: Edit `Keyboard.module.css` or other component styles.
- **Increase difficulty**: Modify
  `const isLoser = incorrectLetters.length >= 6;` in `App.tsx` to change the max
  number of mistakes allowed.
