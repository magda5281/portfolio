# CorpComment

**Educational project React + TypeScript + Vite**

CorpComment is a simple feedback‚Äêcollector app built with Vite, React and
TypeScript. Along the way I explored controlled inputs, validation,
children-composition patterns, data fetching, Context, performance
optimizations, and‚Äîfinally‚ÄîZustand for state management.

## Demo

CorpComment is deployed to **Vercel**.

## ü§î What Is It?

A lightweight single-page app where anyone can leave a public comment for a
company via a feedback form. Key points:

- **Hashtag requirement**: Every comment must include a hashtag (e.g.
  `#AcmeCo`).
- **Persistence**: Comments are saved to a backend JSON store (auto-deleted
  after 30 minutes).
- **Hashtag list**: All companies you‚Äôve mentioned appear as clickable buttons
  to filter the feed.
- **Mindful commenting**: Comments become publicly visible‚Äîplease keep them
  respectful and constructive.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech & Tools

- **Vite** ‚Äì lightning-fast dev and build tool
- **React 18 + TypeScript** ‚Äì strongly-typed components and hooks
- **CSS** ‚Äì responsive styles (mostly hard-coded in px for brevity)
- **Context API** (archived for reference) ‚Üí **Zustand** (final)
- **Custom Hooks** (archived for reference)
- **`fetch` API** (GET & POST)
- **`useMemo`** ‚Äì optimizes filtered lists

## üìã Key Features

1. **Character Counter & Validation**

   - Enforces a configurable `MAX_CHARACTERS`.
   - Prevents input beyond the limit.
   - On submit, shows a ‚Äúvalid‚Äù or ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù outline for a few seconds.

2. **Hashtag-Based Comments**

   - Every feedback must include at least one `#CompanyName`.
   - Invalid submissions (too short or missing `#`) are rejected client-side.

3. **Live Feed & Filter**

   - Fetched feedbacks rendered as a list.
   - A ‚Äúhashtag list‚Äù shows all companies mentioned.
   - Click a hashtag to filter the feed.

4. **Data Persistence**

   - **GET** `/api/feedbacks` to load all comments
   - **POST** `/api/feedbacks` to add a new comment  
      (Note: deleted after 30 min) CorpComment interacts with a RESTful JSON
     endpoint for managing feedback: All communications use standard HTTP verbs
     and JSON payloads, following core REST principles for a clean, predictable
     interface.

5. **State Management Evolution**
   - Prop drilling -> Context + custom hooks (left in code for reference)
   - Final: **Zustand** store for minimal boilerplate & memoized selectors &
     improved performance
