## Features

- **Search**: Search for remote developer roles by keyword input.
- **Pagination**: Job listings are split into pages, enabling easy navigation
  through results.
- **Sorting**: Order results by relevance or by most recent posting date.
- **Job Details**: Click a listing to view full job information in a dedicated
  panel.
- **Bookmarking**: Save favorite jobs to local storage; bookmarks persist across
  sessions and appear in a bookmark popover.
- **Fetching data and Caching**: Instant data retrieval and background updates
  via React Query.
- **Context API & Custom Hooks**: Centralize state (search criteria, bookmarks,
  pagination) with React Context and custom hooks for cleaner components.
- **Shareable URLs**: Encode search state and active job in the URL for easy
  sharing.
- **Error Handling & Notifications**: Leverage react-hot-toast to surface
  network or API errors as unobtrusive toast messages.
