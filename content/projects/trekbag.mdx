# TREKBAG

> A modern React & Vite app to manage your packing list—built with advanced
> React patterns and optimized with Zustand for global state and persistence.

## Demo

🔗 **<a href="https://trekbag-seven.vercel.app" target="_blank">TREKBAG</a>**

## Features

- **Add & Remove Items**  
  Add new items via a controlled form and delete or toggle them individually.
- **Checkbox List**  
  Manage “packed” state with `useState` and map over your items array.
- **Sorting UI**  
  Use [react-select](https://react-select.com) to sort by status.
- **LocalStorage Persistence**  
  Automatically persist your list between sessions using Zustand’s built-in
  persist middleware.
- **Separation of Concerns**  
  Component logic lives in custom hooks or the store, while presentation stays
  in dumb UI components.
- **Memoization & Performance**  
  Derive filtered and sorted lists with `useMemo`; avoid unnecessary re-renders
  with zustand selectors.
- **Children Composition**  
   Flexible layout via `children` props, evolving from prop-drilling to context
  and finally to Zustand.

  ⚠️ **Styling & Responsiveness**  
  Styling was not a priority for this project, so the UI isn’t fully responsive.

## Evolution

1. **Prop Drilling**  
   All state and update handlers lived in `App.jsx` and were passed down through
   multiple layers. Functional components with props & `children` composition
   were used originally
2. **Context API + Custom Hook**  
   Introduced an `ItemsContextProvider` and `useItemsContext` to avoid
   prop-drilling, with manual localStorage sync.
3. **Zustand Store**  
   Replaced Context entirely with a lightweight Zustand store (`itemsStore.js`)
   using its `persist` middleware to handle localStorage automatically.
   > The old `contexts/` folder and `lib/hooks.js` remain in the repo for
   > reference only.

## Tech Stack

- **App Framework**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- **State Management**:
  [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) (with
  `persist`)
- **UI**: Functional components with props & `children` composition
- **Sorting**: [react-select](https://react-select.com)
- **Deployment**: Vercel
